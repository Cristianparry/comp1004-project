The project is a password manager that would help the user to remember their passwords. The project will allow the user to see the
passwords that they have saved. This would allow the user to take a shorter time when the user is loging into the other websites.
The project makes sure that they if the user needed to they can delete their password that they have saved and they can edit
the passwords if it is needed making sure that they don't delete it each time. The user can also delete their account if they
don't wish to use our servies anymore. The Json file has be been made in a way that they data that is inputted can be saved if 
it needs to be but it doesn't use an external file to make sure that the web page can be used an device and this cause less load 
and stress onto the device. This means that data can still be saved but it will not be external and this means that they code for 
the project takes less room and this that less powerful laptops will still be able to run the code. The project was complete 
using agile methodology meaning that chnages where made to the visual studio file over the timeline of the project and then the 
final working code uploaded to the here when it was at a good enough stage to added.
